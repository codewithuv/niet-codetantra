# Programming Language
<br>

## Q1

✅ A programmer need to understand the syntax of the programming language.

◻︎ The computer cannot understand a program written in machine language.

✅ A program written in a particular language has to be translated into machine language.

◻︎ A program written in a machine language is machine independent.

✅ It is a time consuming process and difficult to isolate errors in a program written in machine language.

## Q2

◻︎ Assembly language is a representation of a high level language.

✅ Assembly language is also known as low level language.

✅ An Assembler is a translator program for converting programs in assembly language to machine language.

◻︎ It is easy to learn assembly language.

## Q3

✅ Interpreters and compilers translate high level language to machine language.

◻︎ A compiler translates one statement at a time.

✅ High level languages are machine independent.

◻︎ The compiler immediately executes a statement before translating the next statement.

## Q4

◻︎ Concurrent Programming is technique that provides execution of operations sequentially.

✅ XML is an example of markup programming language.

✅ Scripting languages are used to automate frequently executing tasks.

◻︎ A compiled programming language is one which interprets and executes statement before the next statement is      interpreted.

✅ Functional programming language uses conditional expressions and recursion to perform computation.

## Q1

No Any Question

## Q2

✅ Understanding exactly the inputs the algorithm needs is the fundamental to understanding the problem.

◻︎ Algorithms + Programs = data structure.

✅ Algorithmic design techniques are the cornerstone for designing algorithms for problems.

✅ Pseudocode, Flowcharts are methods of expressing an algorithm.

◻︎ An algorithm which works as expected for few of the inputs proves its correctness.

✅ An Algorithm should be both time and space efficient besides being simple.

## Q1


```python
n=int(input("num: "))
s=n
fact=1
i=1
if n>=0:
    while i<=n:
        fact=fact*i
        i=i+1
    print("factorial of",s,"is:",fact)
else:
    print("enter a positive value")
```
