## Q4


```python
# Take an integer input from the user and store it in variable "a"
a=input("a: ")
# Take an integer input from the user and store it in variable "b"
b=input("b: ")
# print "a" value at 0 index and "b" value at 1 index
print("The value of a = {0}, b = {1} ".format(a,b))
# print by changing the index postions of "a" and "b" and observe the output

# print the number with one space
print("%d"%(int(b)))
# print the number with two spaces
print("%2d"%(int(b)))
# print the number with three spaces
