# Error Handling



## Q1

✅ A error is generally a bug in the program usually caused by the developer who develops the code.

✅ There are generally three types of errors.

✅ Syntax errors are mistakes that happen if the programs that are written do not use the correct format of the language.

◻︎ Syntax Errors are the most difficult to be corrected.

## Q2

✅ Logical Errors are the most difficult errors.

✅ Programs that have Logical Errors get compiled and executed but give wrong results.

✅ Logical Errors can be caused by the usage of the wrong variable name.

◻︎ Integer Division is a type of Runtime Error.

## Q3

✅ A program may exit unexpectedly during execution if it encounters a runtime error.

✅ A runtime error is a problem that was not detected when the program was parsed by the interpreter, but is only found out at a specific line execution.

✅ When a program exits when a run time error occurs, we say the program crashed.

✅ Division by zero is not a logical error.
