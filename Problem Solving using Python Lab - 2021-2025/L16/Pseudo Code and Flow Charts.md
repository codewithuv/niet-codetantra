# Pseudo Code


## Q1

◻︎ Programs written in pseudo code can be compiled and executed.

✅ Pseudo code has no standards but guidelines exist.

◻︎ You should know programming language to write pseudo code.

◻︎ Multi line iterations cannot be represented in pseudo code.

## Q2

◻︎ In an if-else condition, the else part gets executed if the condition is true.

✅ In the For-loop the condition is evaluated for each iteration of the loop.

◻︎ The While loop is executed only when the condition is false.

✅ In the While loop, the condition is evaluated for each iteration of the loop.

## Q3


```python
n=int(input("num: "))
sum=0
s=n
if n>0:
    while n>0:
        sum=sum+n
        n=n-1
    print("sum:",sum)
else:
    print("enter positive value")
```

## Q4

◻︎ The advantage of Pseudo code is that it is ambiguous and uncertain.

✅ Pseudo code can be translated to high level languages.

◻︎ Pseudo code by nature is structured and expressive.

✅ Pseudo code can easilly understand by the programmers and users.

# Flow Charts

## Q1

✅ Diamond shaped symbol is used in the flowcharts to indicate a decision (or branching).

✅ A flowchart is a pictorial representation of an algorithm.

✅ An algorithm and a flowchart can help us to clearly specify the sequence of steps to solve a given problem.

◻︎ A flowchart gives us a clear overview of the program but not the solution

## Q2


```python
# write your code here
r=float(input("Enter the radius : "))
if r>=0:
    a=3.14*r*r
    print("Area of circle = %f"%a)
else:
    print("Enter a positive value upto 100")
```

## Q3

✅ Flow charts help in understanding the logic of a program.

✅ Flowcharts help in debugging process.

◻︎ Flowcharts may become complex and clumsy for simple problems.

✅ A lot of time is needed for drawing flow charts for large projects.
